<h1>Initial Task:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Create an etch-a-sketch app that allows the user to fill in a 16 x 16 grid and make whatever drawing they so choose to make.</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Finished App:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Created an etch-a-sketch app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that defaults to a 16 x 16 grid and has the ability for the user to choose their own grid,             up to a 64 x 64 grid.</li>
        <li>Each cell changes color or erases upon the user's mouse hovering over each cell.</li>
        <li>The default color for changing the cells is Black, but the user can also choose RGB and Grey.</li>
        <li>The user can also erase cells if they made a mistake on their drawing, as well as reset and clear the entire grid if they want to start over.</li>
    </ul>
