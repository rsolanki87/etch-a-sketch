Initial Task:
    -Create an etch-a-sketch app that allows the user to fill in a 16 x 16 grid and make whatever drawing they so choose to make.

Finished App:
    -Created an etch-a-sketch app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that defaults to a 16 x 16 grid and has the ability for the user to choose their own grid, up to a 64 x 64 grid.
    -Each cell changes color or erases upon the user's mouse hovering over each cell.
    -The default color for changing the cells is Black, but the user can also choose RGB and Grey.
    -The user can also erase cells if they made a mistake on their drawing, as well as reset and clear the entire grid if they want to start over.
